Directory ~/.vim/local/ is for your own ~/.vimrc files.
You can put here machine or user specific configuration files.


EXAMPLE:
--------

At server netzworkk.de will user 'kiste' set variable 'g:company'
to "Netzworkk". He don't will change anything in '~/.vimrc',
because he is using the same config file at server kainetz.de.
Therefore he creates file '~/.vim/local/vimrc-netzworkk' and put
in then:

    let g:company="Netzworkk"

If user 'kai' at server kainetz.de will set 'g:company' to
"Kai Software", he put in '~/.vim/local/vimrc-kai' (or
'~/.vim/local/vimrc-kainetz') this line:

    let g:company="Kai Software"
