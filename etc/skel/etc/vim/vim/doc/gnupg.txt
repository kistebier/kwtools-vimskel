INTRODUCTION                                    *gnupg*

This script implements transparent editing of gpg encrypted files. The
filename must have a ".gpg", ".pgp" or ".asc" suffix. When opening such
a file the content is decrypted, when opening a new file the script will
ask for the recipients of the encrypted file. The file content will be
encrypted to all recipients before it is written. The script turns off
viminfo, swapfile, and undofile to increase security.


COMMANDS                                        *gnupg-commands*

gnupg.vim makes the following commands available:

:GPGEditRecipients
Opens a scratch buffer to change the list of recipients. Recipients that
are unknown (not in your public key) are highlighted and have
a prepended "!". Closing the buffer makes the changes permanent.

:GPGViewRecipients
Prints the list of recipients.

:GPGEditOptions
Opens a scratch buffer to change the options for encryption (symmetric,
asymmetric, signing). Closing the buffer makes the changes permanent.
WARNING: There is no check of the entered options, so you need to know
what you are doing.

:GPGViewOptions
Prints the list of options.
